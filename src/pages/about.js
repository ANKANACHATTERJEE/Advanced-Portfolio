          <p className="text-base xs:text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-md lg:text-md xl:text-md 2xl:text-md mb-4">
            Hello, I'm Ankana Chatterjee, a passionate and dedicated Full Stack Developer with a strong background in Computer Science. My journey in the tech world began with a curiosity for how things work, which eventually transformed into a deep love for creating innovative and efficient web applications.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base xs:text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-md lg:text-md 2xl:text-md xl:text-md mb-4">
            With expertise in both front-end and back-end development, I have honed my skills in technologies such as JavaScript, React, Node.js, and various other modern frameworks and tools. I'm always excited to learn new things in the web development world. 
            I have also had the opportunity to lead the web development team at HackClub, one of the top tech clubs at my college. It was a fantastic experience that allowed me to dive deep into web development while working with a talented and enthusiastic team.
            Besides web development, I've also dabbled in projects involving Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

          <p className="text-base xs:text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-md lg:text-md xl:text-md 2xl:text-md mb-4">
            I hold a degree in Computer Science, which laid the foundation for my technical knowledge and problem-solving abilities. Over the years, I have worked on numerous projects, ranging from small business websites to large-scale applications. My professional experiences have provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the software development lifecycle, agile methodologies, and the importance of teamwork and communication in delivering successful projects.

          <p className="text-base xs:text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-md lg:text-md xl:text-md 2xl:text-md mb-4">
            When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me dancingâ€”I'm a trained dancer. I also love experimenting in the kitchen and trying out new recipes, so you could call me an experimental chef. Reading has been a passion of mine since childhood, and I enjoy diving into a good book whenever I get the chance.
          </p>
